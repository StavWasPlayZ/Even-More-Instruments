# Instrument Type
Interface Type: Grid / Other

## If Other
Explain why:
Provide the interface you believe is right for the instrument (as image or working code with in-game screenshots), along with their keybinds:

## If Grid
Grid dimensions: Default (7x3) / Other

### If Other
Explain why:
>Please note that instruments with rows other than 7 cannot interact with some API features, such as MIDI implementations. In general, instruments other than the default layout require extra attention. Please have valid reason when choosing this option.

Note layout: Default (`C, D, E, F, G A, B`)
> This may change depending on the provided sounds. Please match the pitch of your instrument to this field. If the layout is inconsistent across rows, you may extend it until the last column, eg:
> ```
> C, D, E, F, G, A, B,
> C, D, E, F, G, A, B,
> C, D, E, F, G, A, B
> ```
