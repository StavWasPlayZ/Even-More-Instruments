The aim is to maximize open source spirit, but also to keep up the credit.  
This project is more so aimed at showcasing the Genshin Instrument's API capabilities than anything more.  
While also being a cool mod, ofc.

If you wish to fork this repo and later re-distribute it, you would probably be better off just writing your own extension mod to Genshin Instruments, and/or use this mod as a dependency.  
Because this is basically all this mod is.

If you *really* need to do any kind of modifications & redistributions, you should probably HMU about it directly.

Moral of the story is just...   
Don't be a d***!

Happy coding! :D
